1. There is no conclusive evidence determining whether the Observable set is discrete or continuous in its most commonly associated dimensions.
	- We shall make no serious effort to accommodate a discrete or continuous system.
	- Compute is most easily done in discrete units, (binary), therefore we shall make a discrete system.
	- IEEE floating point, and floating points system, are often misunderstood by many, and are **not** a replacement for the ℝ set.

Abelian groups must satisfy certain requirements including,
Closure, identity element and inverse element. Also have to see
which matters more, associativity or commutativity or if both are needed.
<!-- 2. If the data and operations on said data form an abelian group then our aether shall be causally invariant.
	- Cyclic groups Z/(n)Z are abelian groups under addition, subtraction and multiplication.
	- Limit bound groups, groups that don't modulo back, but remain and stop at the upper or lower limit are **not** abelian groups under addition, subtraction, and multiplication. See Saturated
	arithmetic.
	- (`arithmetic type`<sup>*</sup>, `<<`) and (`arithmetic type`, `>>`) are not abelian groups.
	- (`arithmetic type`, `|`) and (`arithmetic type`, `&`) are abelian groups.
	- If (input set, operation) is an abelian group, and both a `read` and `write` must be done on the same element, the `read` and `write` must be done atomically. -->
3. Dealing with `arithmetic type` overflows.
