1. The Observable set has at times certain numerical constraints, e.g. Plank constant, energy states of electrons, where 'jumps' occur. Floating point systems also have this effect. It would be interesting to run calculations and see if the ratio of these jumps match an nth floating system. Also note that floating point systems have jumps both in the really big and the really small.

2. I wonder what kind of abelian groups exist that

3. Due to the conservation of quanta the discrete dimensional space rapidly reaches states of thermal death. Without either creating virtual pairs, or pumping back quanta into the system, the observable set reaches equilibrium with a low quanta field. In theory this would be fine, but low quantized energy levels pose a problem for the simulation. This has to do with subjecting the simulation to calculation sub plank in order to ensure the conversation of this quanta. However such calculation produce sub plank results at which the two options are either to accept to loss of quanta, and thus violating the conversation of quanta, or getting rid of the discrete nature of the simulation. Both of these are problematic in their own right. The later of which only pushes this problem back since the computational framework in which the simulation is run is by nature discrete.
